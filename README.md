# SearchEngine

This search engine functions as a Jupyter Notebook-based user-input search engine. It makes use of various APIs and data analysis to achieve the final result. 

## Tools used

The programming language used is Python. The API used for the structure and functionality is Whoosh. Also processed an entire JSON file that is not part of the code here that contains 3 GB of data I processed. 

## To import 

```zsh
pip install Whoosh
```

## Usage

Type into the query string the item that you want to use. Make sure the unicode is still active so that the Whoosh searcher can process your input.
